# OpenAquaponics
An open-source aquaponics project, developed for the Computer Science Interdisciplinary Capstone at Montana State University during the Spring 2025 semester. This project was built for a Raspberry Pi Model 3B+ using Python and Django, with Adobe Dreamweaver utilized for HTML5 web design.

## Features:
- Easily built with off-the-shelf parts (and a whole lot of electrical tape)
- Scalable design with the ability to incorporate more sensors in the future.
- Easy-to-use web interface for system monitoring
- Ability to export system data as CSV for data analysis
